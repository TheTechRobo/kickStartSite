title: BGLUGwatch development paused
---

The title says it all. I have suspended development on BGLUGwatch because lately I've been pretty busy and have gotten the feeling that no one actually uses my software.
If YOU like BGLUGwatch please tell me by "star"ing the repo [here](https://github.com/thetechrobo/bglugwatch).
Sorry for this inconvenince.
