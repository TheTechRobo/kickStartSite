title: Discontinuing bglugwatch-binaries
released: true

I had to discontinue bglugwatch-binaries :'/
Why? Because once I finish the new and improved rolling release system, it will download the file each time (even if there is nothing to download!) and the files are like 10MB each.

Unless I use something like zsync_curl (which I would need to set up (and you guys know how *I* set things up)) it is a Lost Cause.

(And PS: unless someone else sets up zsync_curl I am not doing it. End of sorry story.)

If anyone would like to set those up that would be great...

But you don't have to. (I would host them on GH Pages but all you'd have to do is maintain the .zsync files)
