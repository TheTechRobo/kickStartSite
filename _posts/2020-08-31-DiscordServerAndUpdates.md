Sorry for not posting much! I've been invested in many other things.

Palc is going great!!!! Mathmod is working on being integrated.

In case you couldn't tell, I now have a discord server (!!) and it's really awesome.

Anyway, I think that's all I'm going to say. Sadly I think feed.xml is deprecated until further notice. It's a lot of work to maintain something that nobody uses -- sounds like Palc, but at least I have fun developing Palc.

So...

See ya in a kia! ;D
