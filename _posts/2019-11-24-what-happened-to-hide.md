title: What happened to hide-app?
---
You are probably wondering about: what happened to my repo `hide-app`?
Well, I accidentally deleted ALL of the files, using an `rsync` that was backwards (the repo wasn't working and I accidentally made it worse with `rsync`!
And I am way too lazy to revert the commit. So you'll have to live with it until I am ready.

Sincerely,
TheTechRobo
