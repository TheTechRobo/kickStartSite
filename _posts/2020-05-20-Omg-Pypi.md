title: OMG PyPi!
released: true

I am on PyPI and Reddit!

I posted a link to my pyGit repo on Reddit. The repo now has two stars and currently over 65% people upvoted, which is pretty good considering it isn't my best project! (Check out [Palc](https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-text-calculator), it's a lot better.)

It's also on PyPI. Which is pretty cool in itself.

See you!
