STAY SAFE, EVERYONE!

Thank you to:

- the FrontLine healthcare workers;
- the developers building the software we rely on, and the hardware manufacterers;
- the scientists that are pouring their heart and soul into a vaccine;
- the government for trying to help keep us safe (I am not going to get into a political debate about Donald Trump); and
- everyone else, who is social distancing even though it's hard.

If I forgot a job, I'm really sorry.

## And here are the announcements I promised:
- Palc v.0.8.5-stable has been released and it looks great!;
- I have been extremely active on Stack Overflow and now have the ability to downvote;
- Palc has gone up from 23% done to 24% done! Wowza!;
- I've been checking out Gitea and in a few years, when I buy a VPS from OVH (going to also be my main site and an [Elive](https://elivecd.org) mirror!) I am going to self-host a [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance and migrate all my code to there. I actually [signed up for an account](https://gitea.com/thetechrobo) just to test migration and the UI, and it looks good so far.

See you all in a bit!
