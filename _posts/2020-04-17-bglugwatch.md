title: BGLUGwatch Binaries ++ Clean Slate
released: true
---
Just six days after recontinuation of BGLUGwatch , I had to start with a clean slate.
Because `git` stores a history of all files, it was going about ~30MB.
Obviously, this is unacceptable, So I [started a clean slate](https://github.com/thetechrobo/bglugwatch-cleanslate) with the binaries in a [separate repo](https://github.com/thetechrobo/bglugwatch-binaries).
Thank you for your interest in my repos!

See you!


Bye :)
