Happy Remembrance Day! I'm keeping all the veterans in my head - and you should too.

Remembrance Day is all about remembering these veterans. You shouldnt treat it as any other day because that's disrespectful to the veterans.

All in all, as yet another Remembrance Day passes, think of all they did for you. I am seriously astounded that they only get one day.
