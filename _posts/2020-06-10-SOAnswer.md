title: Dynamically creating variable names
released: true
---

(This has been copy-pasted from my answer that can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62303554/9654083). It was a question about dynamically creating variable names in Python.)

I don't know why others haven't thought of this:

`yourvariableName = randint(0,1000)`
`exec("var_%s = 'value'" % yourVariableName)`

I just thought of it myself. I hope it helps you.

A downside is you can't just do this:

`print(var_yourVariableName)`

you can only do this:

`exec("print(var_%s)" % yourVariableName)`

But you can probably circumvent this one way or another. Leave a comment if you manage to figure it out.

One more downside â€” if used in certain ways, it could be very insecure (as we are using `exec`), so make sure to cover any holes!
