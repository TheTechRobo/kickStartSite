title: It's been a year

It's been a year since I created my account on GitHub, created `python-shell`, and programmed happily.

In that year, I've learned so much about Python, git, and open-source in general. I've also had two pull requests to my own repos.

I also learned that I'm going to need to move to Gitea.

It's probably going to be when I get a VPS, because then I can get a self-hosted one.

I'm going to have a self-hosted Gitea server. And it's going to be fun.

However, there will have to be a guideline â€” if you create a repo, and it's not related to me at all, I will download the source and give copies of all issues, PRs, etc to your email address and on a repo that is probably going to be called `admin/deletedrepos` or something.

Anyway, back to the main blog topic --

In a year's time, I have taken Palc to v.0.9-stable, contributed to many repos, and learned countless things.

One thing though -- in a world of open-source, don't get discouraged by the haters. There will always be haters -- dislikes for no reason, hurtful comments, etc. But know this -- there are more kind people than haters. If there is one hater, there will be five lovers. Keep this in mind when you contribute to open-source -- and have fun!
