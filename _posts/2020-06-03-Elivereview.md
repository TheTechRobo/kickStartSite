title: <REVIEW> Elive 3.8.2 (Review)
released: true
---
Elive. Just the name of it is awesome. And the OS is even better. It's based off of Debian "Buster" and its DE is Enlightenment. The
perfect combination.

Elive is by far the fastest OS I have ever tried., it is so easy to use and beautiful! You NEED to get it.

32bit version is Freeware but 64bit version is Donationware **OR** you can also write a review (like me!)

But I'm not writing this for the 64bit. I already participated in the forums, which grants you an automatic free download. No, I'm
writing this because Elive's future is in jeopardy. Less than one donation is recieved per day, leading to slower  releases, leading
to less donations again, leading to even slower releases, and finally the project would die.

So, download Elive and revive your old PC. (2.0 repos are still working, even though the latest version (as of right now) is 3.8.8!)

If you have a new PC, I suggest 64bit 3.8.11. If you have a new-ish PC with less than 4GB of RAM, 32bit is your mate. If you have
a PC from about 2012 and behind, I'd suggest 3.0.4 stable (even though it uses Debian Wheezy.) Your PC is from 2008 and behind, try
2.0, which is based off of Debian 'Lenny'. And finally, older than 2004 should use 1.0 and earlier.

HOWEVER...My Dell Precision 370 with a Pentium 4 @ 3.4 Ghz and just 2GB RAM is working FINE on 32-bit 3.8.11. So... Elive is really really really light.

Switch now! You *won't* regret it.
