First of all - **no, I'm not dead.** I know I never post here but that's because school.

Second of all - here's an announcement copypasted from [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/4mnBwEd):

> Hello @everyone! Sorry for the ping but I'd like to say a few things-
> First off, I'd really appreciate it if you could just take a few seconds out of your time and request to your favourite YouTubers and podcasters to use human-created captions on their videos/recordings!  So many people need these and auto-generated ones - just don't cut it and it probably feels insulting that content creators don't care about them. Thanks to people like you, Gordon Ramsay and a lot of other famous people have started adding human-created captions to their videos!
> Second of all, running BOINC is a great way to contribute to society. Your computer has so much unused processing power even while you're doing things...BOINC uses that extra processing power to do things like analyze asteroids, help cure cancer, predict climate change, etc. This really helps scientists because many just can't afford to get a huge supercomputer. Plus, if enough people run it, it's better than a supercomputer! It won't get in your way either - it runs transparently until you want to check the stats or change the settings. That's right - you can fine-tune the settings! You might say, "but I'm already folding with Folding@home", which is great too, as you're supporting medical things, but if you want to support a wide variety of things, try out BOINC. It even has a "Science United" option where you choose the science field(s) - it chooses the projects. Check it out! <https://boinc.berkeley.edu/>


Third of all - I'm working on a cool new wiibsite.<sub>No that's not a typo</sub> Try clicking things! <https://thetechroboextra.github.io>

And lastly (but not...leastly i guess?) - Palc is going amazingly and its core can now be used in other programs!
