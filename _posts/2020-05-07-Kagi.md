title: "Kagi: a new search engine?"
released: true

Hello!

Earlier I was looking at the DragThing website and saw that in 2016 their payment processing platform (Kagi) died. Intrigued, I clicked the attached article and read.

I went to kagi.com because apparently they had new servers for if you needed to recover your data, and saw a kind of command prompt.

It said to type /help for help... So I did. I mean, what vulnerabilities could there be typing in `/help`??

It appeared to be a search engine. And I really loved it.

Essentially, it was a **lot** like Linux in that you can "cd" into websites and from then on searches would only search on that website.

There were other cool things too. I even registered for an account.

But -- I couldn't find the company that makes it. Which makes me think -- what is the drawback/privacy concern of it?

Boy, if they didn't want anyone snooping around in their website, they sure did a good job. Everything was on a single line when I viewsourced it, even the JS.

So -- someone tell me:...Is it a harmless search engine... or data-salemania?
